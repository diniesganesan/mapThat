## Inspiration
We wanted to create a way for people to go beyond static maps and reviews—to capture and share meaningful experiences tied to real locations. Whether it’s the best spot to work remotely, a hidden bird-watching trail, or a memorable event, there wasn’t a simple way to map personal moments in a structured, discoverable way. That’s how MapThat was born.

## What it does
MapThat is a mobile-first app built on Google Maps that lets users drop custom markers to log and share experiences. Each marker can be categorized (fitness, food, nature, workspaces, events) and tagged by time—past, present, or future. Users can filter the map by category and view either their own experiences or those shared by others.

## How we built it
We used the Google Maps API, integrated it with React frontend, and IndexedDB to store user data and experience markers. We implemented dynamic filtering, location tagging, and category-based organization.
